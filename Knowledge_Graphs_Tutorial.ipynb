    "\n",
    "### üîç Definition\n",
    "A **Knowledge Graph** is a network of real-world entities (people, places, things, concepts) and their relationships, stored in a graph database format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üèóÔ∏è Core Components\n",
    "1. **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent entities (e.g., Person, Movie, Company)\n",
    "2. **Relationships (Edges)**: Connect nodes and represent how entities relate\n",
    "3. **Properties**: Attributes that describe nodes and relationships\n",
    "4. **Labels**: Categories that group similar nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Graph vs. Traditional Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Relational Database | Knowledge Graph |\n",
    "|--------|-------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Structure** | Tables with rows/columns | Nodes connected by relationships |\n",
    "| **Relationships** | Foreign keys, JOINs | Direct connections |\n",
    "| **Schema** | Fixed schema | Flexible, schema-optional |\n",
    "| **Queries** | SQL | Cypher, SPARQL |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Structured data, transactions | Connected data, pattern detection |\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü Why Use Knowledge Graphs?\n",
    "- **Intuitive**: Mirrors how humans think about relationships\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Easy to add new entity types and relationships\n",
    "- **Performance**: Fast traversal of connected data\n",
    "- **Insights**: Reveals hidden patterns and connections\n",
    "- **Integration**: Combines data from multiple sources naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ Real-World Applications\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Amazon product recommendations\n",
    "- **Fraud Detection**: Banking, insurance claim analysis\n",
    "- **Social Networks**: Facebook's social graph, LinkedIn connections\n",
    "- **Knowledge Management**: Google's Knowledge Graph, Wikipedia\n",
    "- **Drug Discovery**: Understanding protein interactions\n",
    "- **Supply Chain**: Tracking dependencies and risks"

    "### üè∑Ô∏è Neo4j Graph Model\n",
    "- **Labeled Property Graph**: Nodes have labels, relationships have types, both can have properties\n",
    "- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity with transactions\n",
    "- **Index-Free Adjacency**: Relationships are stored as pointers, enabling fast traversals\n",

    "**Cypher** is Neo4j's declarative query language, designed to be:\n",
    "- **Visual**: Syntax resembles graph drawings\n",
    "- **Expressive**: Handles complex graph patterns\n",
    "- **Readable**: Close to natural language\n",

    "```cypher\n",
    "// Node pattern\n",
    "(n)           // Any node\n",

    "#### üéØ Best Practices for Cypher Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Labels and Indexes**\n",
    "   ```cypher\n",
    "   // Good: Use specific labels\n",
    "   MATCH (p:Person {name: \"Tom Hanks\"})\n",
    "   \n",
    "   // Avoid: Scanning all nodes\n",
    "   MATCH (p {name: \"Tom Hanks\"})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start with Most Selective Patterns**\n",
    "   ```cypher\n",
    "   // Good: Start with specific node\n",
    "   MATCH (specific:Movie {title: \"The Matrix\"})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(g:Genre)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   // Avoid: Start with broad pattern\n",
    "   MATCH (g:Genre)<-[:BELONGS_TO]-(m:Movie {title: \"The Matrix\"})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use LIMIT Early**\n",
    "   ```cypher\n",
    "   // Good: Limit early in processing\n",
    "   MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)\n",
    "   WITH p, count(m) AS movieCount\n",
